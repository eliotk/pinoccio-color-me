pinoccio-color-me
=================

A simple [pinoccio](https://pinocc.io/) javascript example that syncs the page background color with the scout LED color.

It uses the official linked version of the pinoccio API.

I tried to add helpful comments and keep the javascript as simple as possible to serve as a "hello world" type example.
